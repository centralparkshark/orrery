    Teams with intermediate programming skills may create a static orrery and teams with more advanced programming skills may create a dynamic orrery.
        A team can use free open-source 3D graphics code libraries to produce a web app that generates an interactive static orrery.
        Making a dynamic orrery requires an orbital propagator.
    NASA data sets containing the orbital trajectories of the planets, NEOs, NECs, and PHAs are available (see Resources).
    The small body database (see Resources) provides Keplerian parameters for NEOs and PHAs; the user interface provides the following constraints to limit the amount of output data:
        Limit by Object Kind/Group - click the numbered option for numbered state then click the checkbox to exclude comet fragments.
        Limit By Orbit Class - select Apollo to limit the output to NEOs that cross Earth’s orbit.
        Custom Object/Orbit Constraints - skip this option unless you want to mathematically limit by orbit parameters.
        Output Selection Controls - scroll down the available fields and select the Keplerian parameters, e.g., e, a, i, peri, M, n, etc…
        Click the Get Results button then click Download CSV Format to get the data into Excel.
    The Resources section includes a link to a paper that may serve as a source of inspiration for potential use cases, functions, and design features of a web app that presents an interactive orrery. The following are examples of notional features your orrery could include:
        Labels for planets, NEOs, NECs, and PHAs.
        Colored orbital trajectories of the celestial bodies.
        User interface controls to turn labels and orbital trajectories on or off.
        Speed control widget for a dynamic orrery.
        Timeline control to display positions of celestial bodies for specified data.
        Widgets to control the point of view or to zoom in and out.
        First-person control for the point of view of flying among the celestial bodies.
        Exterior and interior views of a spaceship flying amongst the celestial bodies in the orrery.
        User interface controls to limit the number of NEOs, NECs, or PHAs to display in the orrery.
        File upload function and control for other orbital parameter data sets.
    Several Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications are great at code generation; consider applying the knowledge you’ve gained about Keplerian parameters and orbital propagators to prompt an AI code generator to produce a web app that updates the position of celestial objects.
    As part of your project submission, don’t forget to provide a link to a deployed web page that has an embedded web app with an interactive orrery.
    Consider testing your web app in more than one web browser because the judges may not use the same web browser used by your team.
    Don’t forget to cite sources for code libraries, web app utilities, data sets, Application Programming Interfaces, and tutorials that provide example source code.
    A section of the project submission addresses artificial intelligence; please fill out that section if you use an AI application to generate source code by explaining the prompts that you wrote.
